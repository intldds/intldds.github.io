[//]: # (Introduction)

I’ve just finished doing the excellent [cadCAD Masterclass](https://www.cadcad.education/course/masterclass-ethereum) 
from [cadCAD Edu](https://www.cadcad.education/) and I’ve felt like sharing some insights about my experience and 
the field of systems engineering / complex systems.

In the first place, [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/) is an open-source Python library that was created as an internal tool
at [BlockScience](https://block.science/). This library helps to design models and simulate their behavior. cadCAD was 
first developed in 2016 (original name was [SimCAD](https://github.com/zengarchi/SimCAD-Tutorials)) as proprietary software at BlockScience to design complex systems 
in a faster way. Recently, in 2019, it was open-sourced to 
[fill a critical gap](https://medium.com/block-science/cadcad-filling-a-critical-gap-in-open-source-data-science-fcd0d3faa8ed) 
in open-source data science. The fact that it is open-source allows an easy and efficient integration with other Python
libraries, making it a very powerful tool.

[Joran Honig](https://joranhonig.nl/) (security auditor at [Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/)) wrote 
an [incredible introductory article](https://joranhonig.nl/getting-familiar-with-cadcad/) about cadCAD that I 
recommend anyone to read.

BlockScience is an engineering and R&D firm specialized in complex systems design and validation. You can find some 
nice resources about them [here](https://block.science/resources) and some great tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gY_cFKHOQ&list=PLmWm8ksQq4YJnNDMaslh20axb4r7fgW_a]) 
and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEiYHRWA9g&list=PLmWm8ksQq4YKtdRV-SoinhV6LbQMgX1we). BlockScience defines and practices the emerging field of Economic Systems Engineering by applying mathematical 
engineering technologies associated with time-tested Systems Engineering practices. They also integrate Game Theory 
and Behavioral Economics, which contributes to the creation of healthy sustainable ecosystems. This looks like the 
perfect set-up for [cryptoeconomics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0FCI8GxO5I)!

As I’ve recently shared, [the study of complex systems](https://miguelemos.co/2021/09/28/systems.html) is a topic that 
is very dear to me and, therefore, going through this cadCAD learning journey was an outstanding experience – in the 
next section I will give you more details about why I enjoyed it so much, as well as some of the things that I've learnt.



[//]: # (Part 1 - 5 points on cadCAD)

<subtitle>On cadCAD</subtitle>

- In a world where web3 is gaining more and more popularity, having an open-source package that allows the user to 
analyze, design and validate complex systems gives you a considerable amount of leverage – cadCAD definitely helps anyone 
to make better system decisions in order to achieve the project goals;

- The cadCAD library follows an EDP (“Engineering Design Process”) approach. 
If you are already an engineer/software developer, you are probably familiar with these steps. During the "System Design"
phase, you'll learn in detail about the **SNL ("Standard Notebook Layout")** that provides step-by-step guidance on how to
model and simulate a system;

<br>

- To validate and simulate your results, you will learn some more advanced techniques, including the 
Monte Carlo Method, Parameter Sweeps and A/B Testing;

- cadCAD modeling and simulation allows you to take a new approach to real-world systems engineering;

- If you enroll on the cadCAD Hacks available at cadCAD Edu, you will have the opportunity to explore real-life 
protocols (e.g. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/)) and pick up the latest tips and tricks. Some other relevant demos can be seen [here](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/demos).
It’s very hands-on and gives you enough room for experimentation, which is the perfect scenario for cryptocurrencies and related protocols! 
Also, the visual graphs always look very beautiful (e.g. tell me this [ETH Supply Simulator](https://www.ethmodel.io/) isn't beautiful?).


[//]: # (Part 2 - 5 points on radCAD)

<subtitle>On radCAD</subtitle>

- During the Masterclass course, we are introduced to a brand-new concept: [radCAD](https://github.com/CADLabs/radCAD). 
radCAD extends on cadCAD, and it is a “Python framework for modeling and simulating dynamical systems”. It was built 
for [modularity and extensibility](https://twitter.com/CADLabs_org/status/1415986905485910023) and works pretty well. For
example, the SNL previously mentioned turns into **SPS ("Standard Project Structure")**, which improves overall performance;

- radCAD is compatible with cadCAD by just installing a few dependencies;

- The Masterclass course dives deep into Modeling Ethereum Validator Economics. So, if you are passionate about 
Ethereum research or if you are just a validator/investor, there’s a good chance you will learn something new and test 
different case scenarios. The course provides a lot of quality material (both in video and in text format). And the
Masterclass was supported by the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/), which is always a nice thing;

- Moreover, the combination of getting immersed in a real-world dynamical system with the fascinating world of the 
Ethereum protocol makes it a great learning experience in the world of cryptoeconomics;

- This framework is becoming increasingly more popular, and some of its [use cases](https://github.com/CADLabs/radCAD#open-source-models-using-radcad)
  include the [Ethereum Economic Model](https://github.com/CADLabs/ethereum-economic-model) by [CADLabs](https://cadlabs.org/),
  the [Beacon Runner](https://github.com/ethereum/beaconrunner) by the [Ethereum RIG](https://github.com/ethereum/rig) and
  the [GEB Controller Simulations](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-simulations) by the
  [Reflexer Protocol](https://reflexer.finance/).
  **In the near future, I expect to see more and more projects using cadCAD/radCAD**.

If you felt confused, here's a [one-stop document](https://www.notion.so/cadcad/cadCAD-Onboarding-TL-DR-e0da826e676344ee94d71d39d65d4fc2) 
for learning about cadCAD and how to use it. Joining the official Discord and asking questions also seems like a good
option!


[//]: # (Conclusion)

<subtitle>Final Thoughts</subtitle>

As you've probably noticed, I strongly recommend taking the Masterclass course by cadCAD Edu. The video lectures have 
extremely high quality (content-wise) and the courses always provide external links and reading lists for you to 
complement your learning process. Also, the course instructors (e.g. [Ben Scholtz](https://twitter.com/benscholtz)) are 
some of the best instructors you will find anywhere. I am not the only one sharing this opinion (see 
[here](https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar/status/1435654972377427970), [here](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot/status/1435590706232442880) and
[here](https://twitter.com/casparschwa/status/1435864942125752323)) - I would trust these guys :)

These courses are designed for multidisciplinary people, including software engineers, systems engineers, data scientists 
and dynamical systems enthusiasts! To complete the Masterclass, you’ll need some intermediate knowledge of Python and 
some knowledge regarding Ethereum 2.0 (*i.e.* EIP-1559, The Merge, Proof-of-Stake, etc). The more multidisciplinary you 
become, the better your chances are of succeeding in web3 lands (aka “the [metaverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiFFbk5dc_Q)").
Also, OSS is essential to the Ethereum community and by completing these courses you will become much closer of getting 
a web3 job (or, at least, get a new perspective on systems/token engineering). The cadCAD/radCAD space is only just 
getting started (it's currently ~ 2 years old), and it is definitely super exciting.

I believe that the integration of [dynamical systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory) (using 
tools such as cadCAD/radCAD) with [mechanism design](https://github.com/jpantunes/awesome-cryptoeconomics#mechanism-design)
and [zero-knowledge technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof) will be a very
powerful combination that will result in some of the best projects that the [web3 space](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402) 
has to offer - the intersection of all these fields will allows us to [optimize a new complex/dynamic system](https://medium.com/block-science/what-does-it-take-to-optimize-a-complex-system-eabb296b829d).
