title: "Paradigm Shift Through Social Coordination (why public goods matter)"
---
Over the last couple of years, I've been fascinated at how cool cryptoeconomics really is! In a few words, cryptoeconomics
is the combination of cryptography with economic incentives - in a perfect world, we should be able to do everything by relying
only on cryptography. However, that is *not* entirely possible and, therefore, 
we [also have to rely on economic incentives](https://youtu.be/ycK3AUTdl1w) (see around the 17-minute mark of 
this video that provides a brilliant overview by Justin Drake of the field).

The fact that it is a new multidisciplinary field that combines Economics with Computer Science
makes it *really* interesting to me - especially considering the potential to affect almost every
area of society.

<ins>**Through this post, I will attempt to cover the following topics:**</ins>
- explain what **cryptoeconomics** *really* is and its potential applications / use cases (*hint*: DeGov);
- give my perspective on why I think cryptoeconomics marks the beginning of a *new* **Industrial Revolution** ("Industry 4.0" as some people might call it);
- justify my reasoning why I believe **mechanism design** is so important to build sustainable systems;
- describe the details that make **social coordination** the most important tool at our disposal.
- portray why **Ethereum** is the global settlement layer behind all of these concepts.

### <ins>A Paradigm Shift</ins> 

A *paradigm shift* is best defined by [Thomas Khun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn)
as "a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline".
In other words, it represents a [major change in society](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paradigm-shift.asp) and is often associated with the rise of 
a new technology.

One clear example of a paradigm shift is the invention of the Internet, which [occurred around the 80s](https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml) 
and changed the way we communicate (i.e. transfer of information).

We can establish a relationship between the definition of a paradigm shift and the 
[History of Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution).
Industrial Revolutions are *always* caused by 

#### Industrial Revolutions in Modern History

Name              | Years                | Name              | Causes / Technology
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
First Industrial Revolution                 | End of 18th century         | "The Industrial Revolution"     | Introduction of water and steam-powered mechanical manufacturing facilities
Second Industrial Revolution  | Start of 20th century | "Technological Revolution" | Introduction of electrically-powered mass production based on the division of labour
Third Industrial Revolution | Start of 1970s | "Digital Revolution" | Uses electronics and IT to achieve further automation of manufacturing (transfer of information)
Fourth Industrial Revolution | 2009 - *present* | Industry 4.0 or 4IR | Uses blockchain technology to transfer all sorts of value, secured by cryptography


The same way that the Internet changed the way we exchange information, we can consider that blockchain
technology is changing the way we transfer value - therefore, by definition, it is fair to consider it to be
a paradigm shift technology ([with the implications that *it* carries](http://www.ee.scu.edu/eefac/healy/kuhn.html)).

Considering the [four "revolutions"](https://kfactory.eu/short-history-of-manufacturing-from-industry-1-0-to-industry-4-0/) mentioned in the table above, I believe that our current one has the potential to **become the most [disruptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation)**
(i.e. affect the most sectors in society, including traditional governance mechanisms and hierarchies).

Also, with each phase, we can observe that a new technology appears and creates a [more effective
way of generating even more value and innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/rebelo/htm/finland.pdf) - 
it's a cycle because knowledge is a public good and, therefore, it has the important properties of being [non-rival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)) 
and [non-excludable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability) (I'm not considering IP rights here, which would make *knowledge* partially excludable).

*Fun fact #1*: [Endogenous growth models](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138581) were always a fascinating area of study to me in college.


### <ins>Mechanism Design</ins> 

As we've seen before, cryptoeconomics and the new paradigm are **all about incentives**. What is the field of science that
studies incentives? That's right - it's [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)!

Even more fascinating and interesting that Game Theory is something called [Mechanism Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design), 
which is also known as *"Reverse Game Theory"*.

I'm a strong believer of the power of Mechanism Design to build [credible-neutral systems](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/), 
that can give *fair* opportunities to all participants of the game. In a way, it is already happening through
the creation of many mechanisms, such as [quadratic funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/),
[quadratic/intensity voting](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/), [prediction markets](https://augur.net/), 
[retroactive public goods funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) and a couple other mechanisms. 

Many mechanism designers believe that we can use incentives and game theory to change the world for the positive. I'll showcase
my intellectual 4-step model on how we can use Mechanism Design for positive-sum games:

  [1] Design rules for a credible-neutral system;

  [2] Implement the mechanism (experiment if it works);

  [3] Iterate the implementation until it works at a small scale;

  [4] Once it works, extrapolate it to bigger agglomerates (adoption phase which might include "smart cities").

In my personal opinion, step [1] is the most important one, and it is *critical* to follow these rules that [Vitalik mentioned](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/):

![rules](/images/simplicity.png)

Out of this four rules, I would argue that "keeping it simple" might be the most important principle to follow. [Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9010638-simplicity-is-the-ultimate-sophistication-when-once-you-have-tasted) 
and having few parameters to manage a complex dynamic system is *not* an easy task to accomplish. The concept of ["Illusory superiority"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority)
also comes to my mind here, mixed with the concept of [intellectual underconfidence](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/02/18/election.html), as we 
sometimes tend to overthink and over-complicate things in order to showcase more than we are required to. 

**It's a bit of a paradox, because in order to achieve *great* things we must follow complex paths. However,
"keeping it simple" is the most important principle. The trick is to follow Naval's advice: 
["It is the mark of a genius to explain a complex topic in a simple way"](https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1420285393887326210).
Simplifying complex processes is one of the greatest skills one can have.**

![paths](/images/paths.jpeg)
<div style="text-align:center">
<sub>Just a guess: take the right lane but keep a clear mind and simplify along the way</sub>
</div>
<br>

So my advice here would be very much like in software engineering: [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and 
design with [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) (the [advantages of modularity in programming](http://gwentechembedded.com/the-advantages-of-modular-software-and-programming/) also
apply to mechanism design - if you're multidisciplinary you *know* that the **principles from one
area always apply to other areas** and that's one of the reasons why Ethereum has so many bright individuals)!

*Fun fact #2*: I’ve always been a huge Kanye West fan and, when I was younger, there was a quote from him that always stuck with me. 
He said, during a [Harvard presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1MmyP1Jjhc), in 2013, 
that [“the world can be saved through design”](https://www.dezeen.com/2013/11/19/the-world-can-be-saved-through-design-says-kanye-west-at-harvard-graduate-school-of-design/ ). 
And he repeated this idea several [more times](https://www.akendi.com/blog/design-will-save-the-world/). 
He was *absolutely* right – as he is in many cases. However, **we will save the world through mechanism design** – which is still a form of design! Thanks, Ye. 

### <ins>DAOs and Smart Cities</ins> 

Ok, since we were talking about *architecture* and *saving the world through design*, let's talk about
another exciting (and related) topic - urban planning and smart cities! I think smart cities are a super enthusiastic
subject.

First of all - what are smart cities? In this context, I'm referring to smart cities as **cities that are a by-product of
the intersection between elegant urban planning and blockchain technology**. I've just found a [paper from
2016](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/176432/1/10.1186_s40854-016-0040-y.pdf) that explains the concept 
perfectly - some people are really forward-thinking!

Of course another critical part of a city is its governance - hence why this section is called "DAOs and 
Smart Cities". [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) are Decentralized autonomous organisations and they are
an effective and safe way to work with like-minded people, with a different structure than a traditional organisation - for
example, a DAO is usually flat and fully democratized in contrast to the old paradigm of having
rigid hierarchical structures. On DAOs, all activity is transparent and fully public. At last, **DAOs don't 
require centrally controlled automation,** which is prone to corruption and manipulation. The voting mechanism is also
more *futuristic*, with the possibility of allowing methods such as [quadratic/intensity voting](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/). 

**Voting is a central pillar of any reliable democratic system, and it is a 
topic [highly underrated amongst informed people](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html).** As Vitalik said, 
"one vote per N years is a 250-year-old form of democracy, and we can have much better democracy if voting were much more 
convenient and simpler, so that we could do it much more often."

**Therefore, an integral part of a "smart city" should be its governance structure and voting
scheme, something that [fits in like a glove in a system with the properties of Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/).**

This [2016 article on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4g8y54/private_cities_a_path_to_liberty_titus_gebel/) 
touches on some points that I've mentioned, and it features a [comment from Vitalik himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4g8y54/private_cities_a_path_to_liberty_titus_gebel/d2g9yyv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
summing up many positive aspects (and caveats) of building "smart cities" (I dislike [the word "private" used in the original article](https://fee.org/articles/private-cities-a-path-to-liberty/) 
and some other aspects, even though the subtitle "Given Voluntary Cooperation, Everything Is Possible" is headed in a favorable direction). The good news is - we can work around some of these caveats with clever mechanism design 
(i.e. incentives *and* penalties) and *build* a city with a 
[concave disposition](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html) approach. To some extent, 
[this is already happening!](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/100647/miami-ethereum-city-services-blockchain)

### <ins>New Jobs and Opportunities</ins> 

It's 2021, we are in the middle of a paradigm shift and the Ethereum protocol is close to being stable (layer 1), after years of research
trying to find the solution to the Scalability Trilemma (which happened through layer 2 solutions such as [rollups](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), 
[data sharding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html), the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/), 
clever [data structures](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html) and 
a combination of [state expiry with weak statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal) for 
managing the [increasing state size in Ethereum](https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar/status/1372645109414563840)). Everything is looking good so far!

With a new paradigm shift, **new jobs usually arise**. Here's a list of some ideas:

* First of all, the **gig economy is upon us**. I love this post of Merwane Drai entitled ["where work is headed"](https://merwanedrai.com/where-work-is-headed/)
because it makes a perfect description of our job market over the recent history It is divided in four main phases: pre-internet; 
2010s (globalization); 2020s (remote / asynchronous remote) and the foreseeable future - the gig economy, where there is no contract or agreement 
and you work on whatever you want to and get paid in cryptocurrencies, while being known by a 
pseudonymous identity. Only hard skills matter in this context. I think COVID-19 accelerated this process and soon enough
the gig economy will be the main paradigm. Let's wait and see;


* **Mechanism designers**: I've already mentioned before - it's mechanism design season, and we need more and more people
designing new systems with strong incentives and clever penalties;


* **City designers**: a combination of Ethereum with urban planning. I've already talked about urban planning
and I will talk again because it is one of my passions thanks to [Jaime Lerner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Lerner), 
a beautiful man who passed away this year and contributed a lot to architecture and urban planning, 
[especially in “his” city of Curitiba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nROMmEJHbM);


* **Ecosystem Developers (or "ecodev")**: someone who connects the dots and [needs to understand how things (really) work](https://www.lakshmansankar.com/#/crypto-ecosystems);


* **Protocol Politicians**: [Politics is coming to crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/sushiswap-migration-defi-protocol-politicians) and
it might be a [very lucrative role](https://www.lakshmansankar.com/#/crypto-ecosystems);


* **Smart Contract Developers**: involves building decentralized applications for the [web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) - this one is 
pretty obvious;


* **Smart Contract Security Experts/Auditors**: auditing smart contracts and finding possible bugs and vulnerabilities. A critical
role/position if we want this decentralized future to work;


* **Frontend engineers**: this one is also obvious because... we still have a long way to go before
making DeFi totally acceptable and usable (which is totally fine, we can't create the perfect UX in a couple of months);


* **Statisticians**: new indices to measure well-being since Gini is overhated;


* **Artificial Intelligence (AI) meets Ethereum**: This is sort of a sub-category of mechanism design,
but I've decided to give it its own category because Karl Floersch is very interested in this subject and I
completely trust him to come up with the craziest schemes we didn't even think about;


* **Researchers (economics/cryptography)**: I expect to see researchers creating economic models that can maximize
the resources and the infrastructure/platform provided by Ethereum. We can finally use cryptoeconomics to solve critical 
problems, such as extreme poverty (which will only be solved once the number becomes 0,000000%). We also need more cryptographers
to contribute to the [roadmap of Eth3](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1333922620857745408) (which is basically a bunch of Advanced Cryptography tools that will make the ecosystem more
secure, scalable and resistant to quantum computing - hopefully I can contribute to this);


* **More engineers (of *many fields*)**: Well, we still have very important issues such as *longevity* and *terminal diseases* that are
(after all) engineering problems! Every problem has a solution, and we are building the mechanisms to fund these researches
and find solutions to these problems. ***Biotech*** will grow exponentially within the next decade and [cryptocurrencies will be
behind this growth](https://www.lifespan.io/news/pulsechain-airdrop-has-raised-20m-for-sens-research/). Another very interesting
and promising area is obviously space travel and interdisciplinary life.


* **Freelancers / Bounty Explorers / Public Goods builders / "Granters"**: With so many new ideas and schemes being created
such as Quadratic Funding (2018), Retroactive Public Goods Funding (2021)


Overall, I predict that the gap between high-technical jobs and low-technical jobs (?). Automation of processes will partially contribute 
to this outcome; Ethereum and DAOs will also contribute by removing intermediaries over the medium-long term. 
And this is still fine, if we introduce and use some clever mechanisms to benefit who needs the most, 
[such as UBI on Ethereum](https://blog.kleros.io/introducing-ubi-universal-basic-income-for-humans/).

<ins>We should also change our approach to two main sectors in society:</ins>

* **Education**: <ins>Promote critical thinking at schools.</ins> We need to urgently change the concept of literacy to 
numbers, letters and code. Schools can no longer be an obsolete system. Education is the root of our future generations. Our 
current education system is a [combination of a small bit of education, large doses of socialization and compliance training, and a 
massive dose of babysitting](https://twitter.com/NavalPodClips/status/1300523756260073472). <ins>Unacceptable.</ins>


* **Medicine**: Just like in the crypto world, I promote a <ins>defensive system for medicine</ins>. I've read
from a Donella Meadows book that doctors used to pay you if you got sick. We need to get back to a similar system.
COVID-19 was really important for medicine and biotech in general, so I expect our main issues in this field
to be reduced within the next 2 decades (i.e. longevity). Therefore, we should start focusing now on defensive medicine
mechanisms such as healthy eating habits, regular sleep patterns, hydration and the social stigmatization of some drugs 
(that might have several beneficial aspects) when compared to, for example, alcohol (which, funny enough, is a completely acceptable drug). 


### <ins>"The Field of Coordination"</ins> 

(Finally arriving where I really want...ufff... a bit tired now)
