title: "Paradigm Shift Through Social Coordination (why public goods matter)"
---
Over the last couple of years, I've been fascinated at how cool cryptoeconomics really is! In a few words, cryptoeconomics
is the combination of cryptography with economic incentives - in a perfect world, we should be able to do everything by relying
only on cryptography. However, that is *not* entirely possible and, therefore, 
we [also have to rely on economic incentives](https://youtu.be/ycK3AUTdl1w) (see around the 17-minute mark of 
this video that provides a brilliant overview by Justin Drake of the field).

The fact that it is a new multidisciplinary field that combines Economics with Computer Science
makes it *really* interesting to me - especially considering the potential to affect almost every
area of society.

<ins>**Through this post, I will attempt to cover the following topics:**</ins>
- explain what **cryptoeconomics** *really* is and its potential applications / use cases (*hint*: DeGov);
- give my perspective on why I think cryptoeconomics marks the beginning of a *new* **paradigm shift**;
- justify my reasoning behind why I believe **mechanism design** is so important to build *sustainable systems*;
- describe why **social coordination** is (and always has been) the most important tool at our disposal;
- portray why **Ethereum** is the global settlement layer behind all of these concepts and what new opportunities might arise out of it.

### <ins>A Paradigm Shift</ins> 

A *paradigm shift* is best defined by [Thomas Khun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn)
as "a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline".
In other words, it represents a [major change in society](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paradigm-shift.asp) and is often associated with the rise of 
a new technology.

One clear example of a paradigm shift is the invention of the Internet, which [occurred around the 80s](https://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit07/internet07_02.phtml) 
and changed the way we communicate (i.e. transfer of information).

We can establish a relationship between the definition of a paradigm shift and the 
[History of Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution).
Industrial Revolutions are *always* caused by 

#### Industrial Revolutions in Modern History

Name              | Years                | Name              | Causes / Technology
--------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
First Industrial Revolution  | 1700s and early 1800s | "The Industrial Revolution" | Introduction of water and steam-powered mechanical manufacturing facilities
Second Industrial Revolution  | Late 19th century into early 20th century | "Technological Revolution" | Introduction of electrically-powered mass production based on the division of labour
Third Industrial Revolution | Start of 1970s | "Digital Revolution" | Uses IT for automation and transfer information
Fourth Industrial Revolution | 2009 - *present* | "Industry 4.0" or "Crypto Revolution" | Uses blockchain technology to transfer [value](https://twitter.com/0x_Lucas/status/1382508361103544323), secured by cryptography


The same way that the Internet changed the way we exchange information, we can consider that blockchain
technology is changing the way we transfer value - therefore, by definition, it is fair to consider it to be
a paradigm shift technology ([with the implications that *it* carries](http://www.ee.scu.edu/eefac/healy/kuhn.html)).

A paradigm shift is always triggered by a new technology or a new innovation. **Technology is the driving force of History**.
If we consider the [technology adoption life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle), we should be aware that there is a gap
(also known as "the chasm") [between innovators and early adopters](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/covid-was-exactly-what-crypto-needed).
In 2020, I believe we've passed "the chasm" and are currently in the "early adopters" phase. Scalability has been (theoretically)
solved and it is just a matter of implementation - once it happens (2022/23), we will move along to the "early majority" phase
faster than we can think of.

Considering the [four "revolutions"](https://kfactory.eu/short-history-of-manufacturing-from-industry-1-0-to-industry-4-0/) mentioned in the table above, 
I believe that our current one has the potential to **become the most [disruptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation)**
(i.e. affect the most sectors in society, including traditional governance mechanisms and hierarchies).

![santiago](/images/santiago.png)
<div style="text-align:center">
<sub>Santiago is right on this one, as he usually is</sub>
</div>
<br>

Also, with each phase, we can observe that a new technology appears and creates a [more effective
way of generating even more value and innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/rebelo/htm/finland.pdf) - 
it's a cycle because **knowledge is a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics))** and, therefore, it has the important properties of being [non-rival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)) 
and [non-excludable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability) (I'm not considering IP rights here, which would make *knowledge* partially excludable).

Not only knowledge is a public good, it also has several [important characteristics](https://www.tlu.ee/~sirvir/Information%20and%20Knowledge%20Management/Key_Concepts_of_IKM/characteristics_of_knowledge.html),
such as enabling higher learning and facilitating effectiveness. Knowledge is [growth](https://www.oecd.org/innovation/knowledge-is-growth.htm).

*Fun fact #1*: [Endogenous growth models](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2138581) were always a fascinating area of study to me in college. In
endogenous growth [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_growth_theory), it is argued that **investment in human capital, 
innovation, and knowledge are significant contributors to economic growth**.
<br>
> The theory also focuses on positive externalities and spillover effects of a knowledge-based economy which will lead 
to economic development. The endogenous growth theory primarily holds that the long run growth rate of an economy depends 
on policy measures. For example, subsidies for research and development or education increase the growth rate in some 
endogenous growth models by increasing the incentive for innovation.<br><br>
An endogenous growth theory implication is that policies that embrace openness, competition, change and innovation will promote growth.

<br>Relevant contributors to the field of endogenous growth models include [Paul Romer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Romer) and
[Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lucas_Jr.). **[Innovation comes from within](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevitasek/2018/11/19/paul-romer-the-path-to-economic-growth-and-innovation/?sh=ba28651139d7)
and Ethereum is the perfect platform to allow that.** 

To sum it up, [knowledge is a public good](http://pinguet.free.fr/stiglitz1999.pdf). Some authors argue that knowledge/innovation is the 
most powerful driving force of an economy. Ethereum is *trying* to promote public goods (<ins>incentives through QF, RPGF, etc</ins>) and, step-by-step, 
[succeeding at it](https://gitcoin.co/results). Now, it is just a matter of time to achieve better levels of coordination and 
to integrate mechanisms (e.g. [MACI](https://appliedzkp.github.io/maci/)) that allow for "bribery-resistant, secure, and private digital voting". 
**It's a new paradigm shift, indeed, and we should all be optimistic about it!** Not only can we
achieve higher levels of growth, we can also build more tools to achieve a more effective way of redistributing that growth,
reduce the inequality gap (that comes as a result from years of hierarchical systems) and create a credible-neutral system.
This is literally ["liberation through radical decentralization"](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/liberation-through-radical-decentralization-22fc4bedc2ac)
time.

### <ins>Mechanism Design</ins> 

As we've seen before, cryptoeconomics and the new paradigm are **all about incentives**. What is the field of science that
studies incentives? That's right - it's [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)!

Even more fascinating and interesting that Game Theory is something called [Mechanism Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design), 
which is also known as *"Reverse Game Theory"*.

I'm a strong believer of the power of Mechanism Design to build [credible-neutral systems](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/), 
that can give *fair* opportunities to all participants of the game. In a way, it is already happening through
the creation of many mechanisms, such as [quadratic funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/),
[quadratic/intensity voting](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/), [prediction markets](https://augur.net/), 
[retroactive public goods funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) 
and a couple other mechanisms. 

![md](/images/md.png)
<div style="text-align:center">
<sub>Vitalik's always a couple years ahead of everyone else</sub>
</div>
<br>

Many mechanism designers believe that we can use incentives and game theory to change the world for the positive. I'll showcase
my mental four-step model on how we can use Mechanism Design to achieve positive-sum games:

1. Design rules for a credible-neutral system;
2. Implement the mechanism (experiment if it works);
3. Iterate the implementation until it works at a small scale;
4. Once it works, extrapolate it to more places.

In my personal opinion, step [1] is the most important one, and it is *critical* to follow these rules 
that [Vitalik mentioned](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/):

![rules](/images/simplicity.png)

Out of this four rules, I would argue that "keeping it simple" might be the most important principle to follow. [Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9010638-simplicity-is-the-ultimate-sophistication-when-once-you-have-tasted) 
and having few parameters to manage a complex dynamic system is *not* an easy task to accomplish. The concept of ["Illusory superiority"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority)
also comes to my mind here, mixed with the concept of [intellectual underconfidence](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/02/18/election.html), as we 
sometimes tend to overthink and over-complicate things in order to showcase more than we are required to. 

**It's a bit of a paradox, because in order to achieve *great* things we must follow complex paths. However,
"keeping it simple" is the most important principle. The trick is to follow Naval's advice: 
["It is the mark of a genius to explain a complex topic in a simple way"](https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1420285393887326210).
Simplifying complex processes is one of the greatest skills one can have.**

![paths](/images/paths.jpeg)
<div style="text-align:center">
<sub>Just a guess: take the right lane but keep a clear mind and simplify along the way</sub>
</div>
<br>

So my advice here would be very much like in software engineering: [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and 
design with [modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) (the [advantages of modularity in programming](http://gwentechembedded.com/the-advantages-of-modular-software-and-programming/) also
apply to mechanism design - if you're multidisciplinary you *know* that the **principles from one
area always apply to other areas** and that's one of the reasons why Ethereum has so many bright individuals)!

*Fun fact #2*: I’ve always been a huge Kanye West fan and, when I was younger, there was a quote from him that always stuck with me. 
He said, during a [Harvard presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1MmyP1Jjhc), in 2013, 
that [“the world can be saved through design”](https://www.dezeen.com/2013/11/19/the-world-can-be-saved-through-design-says-kanye-west-at-harvard-graduate-school-of-design/ ). 
And he repeated this idea several [more times](https://www.akendi.com/blog/design-will-save-the-world/). 
He was *absolutely* right – as he is in many cases. However, **we will save the world through mechanism design** – which is still a form of design! Thanks, Ye. 

### <ins>DAOs and Smart Cities</ins> 

Ok, since we were talking about *architecture* and *saving the world through design*, let's talk about
another exciting (and related) topic - urban planning and smart cities! I think smart cities are a super enthusiastic
subject.

First of all - what are smart cities? In this context, I'm referring to smart cities as **cities that are a by-product of
the intersection between elegant urban planning and blockchain technology**. I've just found a [paper from
2016](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/176432/1/10.1186_s40854-016-0040-y.pdf) that explains the concept 
perfectly - some people are really forward-thinking!

Of course another critical part of a city is its governance - hence why this section is called "DAOs and 
Smart Cities". [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) are Decentralized autonomous organisations and they are
an effective and safe way to work with like-minded people, with a different structure than a traditional organisation - for
example, a DAO is usually flat and fully democratized in contrast to the old paradigm of having
rigid hierarchical structures. On DAOs, all activity is transparent and fully public. At last, **DAOs don't 
require centrally controlled automation,** which is prone to corruption and manipulation. The voting mechanism is also
more *futuristic*, with the possibility of allowing methods such as [quadratic/intensity voting](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/). 

**Voting is a central pillar of any reliable democratic system, and it is a 
topic [highly underrated amongst informed people](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html).** As Vitalik said, 
"one vote per N years is a 250-year-old form of democracy, and we can have much better democracy if voting were much more 
convenient and simpler, so that we could do it much more often."

**Therefore, an integral part of a "smart city" should be its governance structure and voting
scheme, something that [fits in like a glove in a system with the properties of Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/).**

This [2016 article on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4g8y54/private_cities_a_path_to_liberty_titus_gebel/) 
touches on some points that I've mentioned, and it features a [comment from Vitalik himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4g8y54/private_cities_a_path_to_liberty_titus_gebel/d2g9yyv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
summing up many positive aspects (and caveats) of building "smart cities" (I dislike [the word "private" used in the original article](https://fee.org/articles/private-cities-a-path-to-liberty/) 
and some other aspects, even though the subtitle "Given Voluntary Cooperation, Everything Is Possible" is headed in a favorable direction). The good news is - we can work around some of these caveats with clever mechanism design 
(i.e. incentives *and* penalties) and *build* a city with a 
[concave disposition](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html) approach. To some extent, 
[this is already happening!](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/100647/miami-ethereum-city-services-blockchain)

### <ins>New Jobs and Opportunities</ins> 

It's 2021, we are in the middle of a paradigm shift and the Ethereum protocol is close to being stable (layer 1), after years of research
trying to find the solution to the Scalability Trilemma (which happened through layer 2 solutions such as [rollups](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), 
[data sharding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html), the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/), 
clever [data structures](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html) and 
a combination of [state expiry with weak statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/verkle_and_state_expiry_proposal) for 
managing the [increasing state size in Ethereum](https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar/status/1372645109414563840)). Everything is looking good so far!

With a new paradigm shift, **new jobs usually arise**. Here's a list of some ideas:

* First of all, the **gig economy is upon us**. I love this post of Merwane Drai entitled ["where work is headed"](https://merwanedrai.com/where-work-is-headed/)
because it makes a perfect description of our job market over the recent history It is divided in four main phases: pre-internet; 
2010s (globalization); 2020s (remote / asynchronous remote) and the foreseeable future - the gig economy, where there is no contract or agreement 
and you work on whatever you want to and get paid in cryptocurrencies, while being known by a 
pseudonymous identity. Only hard skills matter in this context. I think COVID-19 accelerated this process and soon enough
the gig economy will be the main paradigm. Let's wait and see;


* **Mechanism designers**: I've already mentioned before - it's mechanism design season, and we need more and more people
designing new systems with strong incentives and clever penalties;


* **City designers**: a combination of Ethereum with urban planning. I've already talked about urban planning
and I will talk again because it is one of my passions thanks to [Jaime Lerner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Lerner), 
a beautiful man who passed away this year and contributed a lot to architecture and urban planning, 
[especially in “his” city of Curitiba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nROMmEJHbM);


* **Ecosystem Developers (or "ecodev")**: someone who connects the dots and [needs to understand how things (really) work](https://www.lakshmansankar.com/#/crypto-ecosystems);


* **Protocol Politicians**: [Politics is coming to crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/sushiswap-migration-defi-protocol-politicians) and
it might be a [very lucrative role](https://www.lakshmansankar.com/#/crypto-ecosystems);


* **Smart Contract Developers**: involves building decentralized applications for the [web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) - this one is 
pretty obvious;


* **Smart Contract Security Experts/Auditors**: auditing smart contracts and finding possible bugs and vulnerabilities. A critical
role/position if we want this decentralized future to work;


* **Frontend engineers**: this one is also obvious because... we still have a long way to go before
making DeFi totally acceptable and usable (which is totally fine, we can't create the perfect UX in a couple of months);


* **Statisticians**: always important to have people who are able to work with theoretical or applied statistics - for
example, statisticians can play an important role in economic modelling for the web3 and create new indices to measure 
well-being and inequality (e.g. there are valid criticisms against the [HDI](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042815/are-there-critics-human-development-index-hdi.asp)
and the Gini coefficient tries to [solve two problems at the same time](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/07/29/gini.html)).


* **Artificial Intelligence (AI) meets Ethereum**: This is sort of a sub-category of mechanism design,
but I've decided to give it its own category because Karl Floersch is very interested in this subject and I
completely trust him to come up with the craziest schemes we didn't even think about;


* **Researchers (economics/cryptography)**: I expect to see researchers creating economic models that can maximize
the resources and the infrastructure/platform provided by Ethereum. We can finally use cryptoeconomics to solve critical 
problems, such as extreme poverty (which will only be solved once the number becomes 0,000000%). We also need more cryptographers
to contribute to the [roadmap of Eth3](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1333922620857745408) (which is basically a bunch of Advanced Cryptography tools that will make the ecosystem more
secure, scalable and resistant to quantum computing - hopefully I can contribute to this);


* **More engineers (of *many fields*)**: Well, we still have very important issues such as *longevity* and *terminal diseases* that are
(after all) engineering problems! Every problem has a solution, and we are building the mechanisms to fund these researches
and find solutions to these problems. <ins>***Biotech*** will grow exponentially within the next decade</ins> and [cryptocurrencies will be
behind this growth](https://www.lifespan.io/news/pulsechain-airdrop-has-raised-20m-for-sens-research/). Another very interesting
and promising area is obviously space travel and [interplanetary life](https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1344040260020424704).
Longevity and interplanetary human life are two things that fit in together [quite well](https://twitter.com/NMAssets/status/1428125177108389888).


* **OSS - Open Source Software**: With so many new ideas and mechanisms being created -
such as Quadratic Funding (2018), Retroactive Public Goods Funding (2021) - it will become increasingly beneficial to work
towards public goods. It's the [metaverse](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1428259544707211265) and it looks 
like [this](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1425914006162735106). Other opportunities for OSS culture include
freelancers (join a DAO Discord and contribute), bug bounty platforms (e.g. [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/)), 
Public Goods builders (via QF or RPGF) or Grants (e.g. [Ethereum Grants](https://ethereum.org/en/community/grants/)).


In the next 5 years, I predict that the gap between high-technical jobs and low-technical jobs will drastically increase due to
automation and Artificial Intelligence (e.g. [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)). Ethereum and DAOs will also 
contribute by removing the layer of intermediaries and reorganizing business structures/hierarchies. 
And this is all fine, if we introduce and use some clever mechanisms to benefit who needs the most, 
[such as UBI on Ethereum](https://blog.kleros.io/introducing-ubi-universal-basic-income-for-humans/).

The title of this post mentions public goods and I really believe that <ins>we should change our approach to the two 
main pillars of a society - education and health:</ins>

* **Education**: <ins>Promote critical thinking at schools.</ins> We need to urgently change the concept of literacy to 
numbers, letters and code. Schools can no longer be an obsolete system. Education is the root of our future generations. Our 
current education system is a [combination of a small bit of education, large doses of socialization and compliance training, and a 
massive dose of babysitting](https://twitter.com/NavalPodClips/status/1300523756260073472). <ins>Unacceptable.</ins>


* **Medicine**: Just like in the crypto world, I promote a <ins>defensive/preventive system for medicine</ins>. 
I was reading this book called "Proportio by Axel Vervoordt" and there is a chapter that taught me that doctors use 
to pay patients if they got sick. COVID-19 was really important for medicine and biotech in general, so I expect our 
main issues in this field to be reduced within the next 2 decades (e.g. longevity). Therefore, we should start focusing 
now on defensive medicine mechanisms such as healthy eating habits, regular sleep patterns, hydration and the social 
stigmatization of some drugs (that might have several beneficial aspects) when compared to, for example, alcohol 
(which, funny enough, is a completely socially acceptable drug). Here's an excerpt from Donella Meadows and, afterwards, the 
quote from Vervoordt's book:
<br>
> Modern medicine in general has shifted the responsibility for health away from the practices and lifestyle of each 
individual and onto intervening doctors and medicines (...) <br><br>
Examples of strengthening balancing feedback controls to improve a system’s self-correcting abilities include: 
preventive medicine, exercise, and good nutrition to bolster the body’s ability to fight disease (...)

<br>

> Western medicine is not preventive, while Chinese medicine is. In Chinese medicine, they see the whole thing, while in 
our countries you go and see a specialist for your toe or your head or your back and there's nobody who sees the entire picture (...)<br><br>
In traditional Chinese medicine, you used to have a contract with your doctor so that while you were healthy, you paid your doctor.
But if you got sick he paid you. That was an incredible strong motivation for your doctor towards preventive medicine!

<br>A combination of blockchain technology with clever mechanisms that incentive public goods will be critical to affect
both education and health - **they are public goods, after all**.

### <ins>"The Field of Coordination"</ins> 

I'm really fond of the expression "field of coordination" because it implicitly expresses two things:

1. Since the beginning of time, the characteristic that separated human beings from everyone else was our
unique **ability to coordinate in large scales**. In the middle of the process, The internet appeared and made it even easier
to coordinate and transfer information without physical barriers;

2. **Public goods matter and we should care about them**. a public good is a good that is both non-excludable 
and non-rivalrous. This means that (i) people cannot be excluded from use the public good and (ii) the use 
of the public good by one individual does not reduce availability to others. Therefore, a public good can be used 
simultaneously by more than one person. Why are public goods so important? Think about... the Internet. It's full
of public goods!

![publicgoods](/images/publicgoods.png)
<div style="text-align:center">
<sub>A good overview of public goods from Finematics</sub>
</div>
<br>

Considering [1] and [2], what if we create mechanisms that incentive the [creation/funding of public goods](https://finematics.com/quadratic-funding-explained/) 
that **benefit all of us**? These mechanisms already exist and go by the name of [Quadratic Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/) 
(e.g. [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/), [CLR.fund](https://clr.fund/#/)) and, when combined with zero-knowledge-proofs 
(*i.e.* [MACI](https://appliedzkp.github.io/maci/)), they can be used to fund public goods in a democratic and secure way. 
The MACI mechanism, alongside with other anti-sybil systems (such as [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/), 
ENS verification, etc), helps to defend the system against collusion attacks and the possibility of one person creating 
several accounts to fund their own projects (*remember*: in QF each donation is matched quadratically). 

I've been watching this space grow in the last 2 years, and it's particularly interesting to see the mechanism iterating
over time, both gaining legitimacy (and, therefore, [more public support](https://gitcoin.co/results)), and
[more awareness against sybil attacks](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-10-governance-brief/). 

Besides Quadratic Funding, [new mechanisms to support and fund public goods are coming up](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c), 
and they are incredible because they promote OSS, open-source culture, transparency, and it is a great starting point for decentralized governance
(or [DeGov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsb7clrXMQ), as coined by Vitalik!). They are also totally aligned with the 
core values and principles that make the Ethereum community so great - **simplicity, universality, modularity, agility, 
non-discrimination and non-censorship**.

This is why I called this section of the post "The Field of Coordination". If we are able to create 
credible-neutral mechanisms that incentive the creation of public goods, we're on a good path towards a
more efficient economic system. If you know anything about the field of [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory),
you probably know that, in the long-term (for iterated games), [**cooperating is always the best strategy**](https://www.quantamagazine.org/game-theory-explains-how-cooperation-evolved-20150212/).

I've read the 1984 book from Robert Axelrod entitled ["The Evolution of Cooperation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation), 
in which the author debates topics such as "The Chronology of Cooperation", "How to Choose Effectively", "How to Promote Cooperation",
"The Social Structure of Cooperation" and "The Robustness of Reciprocity", amongst others. One of the quotes from the book
that really struck with me was this one:
<br>
> "By the final chapter, the discussion has developed from the study of the emergence of cooperation among egoists
**without central authority** to an analysis of what happens when people actually do care about each other and what happens when 
there is central authority. But the basic approach is always the same: seeing how individuals operate in their own interest 
reveals what happens to the whole group. This approach allows more than the understanding of the perspective of a single player. 
It also provides an appreciation of what it takes to promote the stability of mutual cooperation in a given setting. The most promising
finding is that if the facts of Cooperation Theory are known by participants with foresight, the evolution of cooperation can be speeded up."

<br>This book was written in 1984! I feel like it fits in like a glove with blockchain technology and the systems
that we are currently building. I've e-mailed the author if he was aware that blockchain technology
promotes the ideas that he discusses in his book - especially the possibility of not having a central authority by relying
on cryptography - and his answer was this one:

![robert](/images/robert.png)

We're still very early and we still have a long way to go. But one thing is for sure: we now have the tools, 
the knowledge and the community to build sustainable systems that incentive cooperative behavior (and [positive-sum games](https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1422520119788548096)) 
in a trustless environment - and we can also introduce penalties to guarantee that [cooperation doesn't fall apart](https://theconversation.com/new-take-on-game-theory-offers-clues-on-why-we-cooperate-38130). 
**Social coordination is the *only* way in which we can [*all* win](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2017.00066)**.

Like [Kevin says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpXPym_m_wA), it's all about coordination and it *has always been*. 
[Cooperative game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory) amongst large groups is not an easy task 
to solve and it should be our number one priority.


### <ins>Conclusion</ins> 

Times are a-Changin' and Ethereum is well positioned to become the [**global settlement layer of value**](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1416082797739929601) 
(all sorts of value, including e.g. [arts/culture](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1421655756848332800)) 
that works as the infrastructure for all these social tools and mechanisms to be built upon.

As the global settlement layer of the world, it is expected that the technology is 
[valued accordingly](https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness/status/1421947463880089603). We are basically reinventing 
[capitalism](https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1426637041912188928) in real time and making it the way it is supposed to be. 

With Ethereum, we can create our own path towards a more *positive* world and literally [program the incentives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-alrVUv6E24) 
(and penalties) that we believe can become legitimate in the long-run. Some people are nice, some people are not - there is
no way to predict their true intentions. With Ethereum, we have a new way system of trust and, therefore, we can remove 
intermediaries that make money providing trust - **they are no longer necessary, because code and cryptography can
replace them**. <ins>Ethereum is a platform of decentralized trust that allows social coordination in a safe environment</ins>.

I agree with [Evan Van Ness](https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness) on this - "centralization is power; power is corruption; 
centralization = corruption; decentralize everything". Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is [great](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/02/05/decentralized-finance-on-blockchain-and-smart-contract-based-financial-markets), 
but it is not the only thing that needs to become decentralized - DeGov should be the next logical step.

It's a [new paradigm](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1344479537191477248) for all mediators - including banks and governments.
We just have to keep building, iterating, adjusting to the new reality and be glad to be part of all of this. A reality
towards more *freedom* and less *corruption*, which requires both **more (cryptoeconomic) tools *and*
[less empires](https://twitter.com/tobyshorin/status/1388940489781485568)**.
