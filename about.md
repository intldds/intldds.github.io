My name is [Waz](https://miguelemos.github.io/) and I love to learn and to build (especially on Ethereum/web3).

I think the whole DeFi movement is really great, but this blog will be more about the
[things that matter outside of DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsb7clrXMQ),
such as decentralized governance, public goods and mechanism design.

Additionally, I *might* write about zero-knowledge technology because I believe it will become increasingly
more [important](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1442039126606311427).

As Justin Drake said, the future of cryptoeconomics is bright and [Ethereum is a machine for turning applied 
cryptography into real-world cryptography](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ric0r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I enjoy writing about things because it [helps me to understand them better](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1368267425309933573).

Also, I believe that rational optimism is the way out. Having a vision 
is important. However, vision without action is useless. But action without vision is directionless.
