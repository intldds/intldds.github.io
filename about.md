My name is [Miguel](https://miguelemos.github.io/) and I love to learn and to build (especially on Ethereum/web3).

I think the whole DeFi movement is really great, but this blog will be more about the
[things that matter outside of DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsb7clrXMQ),
such as decentralized governance, public goods and mechanism design.

Additionally, I might do some tutorials on zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) because they are
really awesome *and* important!

As Justin Drake said *extremely well*, the future of cryptoeconomics is bright and [Ethereum is a machine for turning applied 
cryptography into real-world cryptography](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ric0r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I enjoy writing about things because it [helps me to understand them better](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1368267425309933573).
