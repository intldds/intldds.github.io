My name is [Miguel](https://miguelemos.github.io/) and I love to learn and to build (especially on Ethereum/web3).

I think the whole DeFi movement is really great, but this blog will be more about the
[things that matter outside of DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsb7clrXMQ),
such as decentralized governance, public goods and mechanism design.

Additionally, I might do some tutorials on zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) because they are
really awesome!

I enjoy writing about things because it [helps me to understand them better](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1368267425309933573).
