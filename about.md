My name is Waz and I love to learn and to build (especially on Ethereum/web3).

I think the whole DeFi movement is really great, but this blog will be more about the
[things that matter outside of DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsb7clrXMQ),
such as decentralized governance, public goods and mechanism design.

Currently, I'm very much into OSS, especially PCD (eg. [Zupass](https://zupass.org/)) and 
[programmable cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAfprVCBhdQ&t) (zkSNARKS, 2PC/MPC, FHE, witness encryption, etc). I've also been embracing
the philosophy of using cryptography as defensive technology, also known as *[d/acc](https://app.streameth.org/devconnect/progcrypto/session/dacc)*.

As Justin Drake said, the future of cryptoeconomics is bright and [Ethereum is a machine for turning applied 
cryptography into real-world cryptography](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/o4unlp/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_6_23_june_2021/h2ric0r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I enjoy writing about things because it [helps me to understand them better](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1368267425309933573).

Also, I believe that [rational](https://nav.al/optimism) [optimism](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html) 
is the way out. Having a vision is important. However, vision without action is useless. But action without 
vision is directionless.
