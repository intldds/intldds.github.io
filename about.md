My name is Miguel and I love to learn and to build (especially on Ethereum/web3).

I think the whole DeFi movement is really great, but this blog will be more about the
[things that matter outside of DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLsb7clrXMQ),
such as decentralized governance, public goods and mechanism design.

Additionally, I might do some tutorials on zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) because they are
awesome!

I enjoy writing about things because it helps me to understand better some concepts.

I'm writing on this blog for the fun of it only, so if you like what you're reading
or if it's (somehow) useful to you, feel free to donate me any amount that you wish
to my Ethereum address @ miguelemos.eth - that would make me extremely happy!
