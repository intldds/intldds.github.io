# About this blog

"Scribblings by Waz" is a [personal blog](https://intldds.github.io/) in which I'll cover many topics related to Ethereum and blockchain 
technology, with a special emphasis on cryptoeconomics, mechanism design, smart contract security and
zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

Over time - and with [quantum computing approaching](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2021/04/28/when-will-quantum-computers-impact-our-day-to-day/?sh=354368c243d9) - I expect to cover some more advanced cryptography concepts and tools (as mentioned in the [Ethereum roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1333922620857745408)).
