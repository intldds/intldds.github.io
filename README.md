# About this blog

**"Scribblings by Waz"** is a personal blog in which I'll write about topics that I'm interested in.

I'm currently interested in Ethereum, **applied/programmable cryptography** and in making the internet a more
interoperable place.

## minima

*Minima is a one-size-fits-all Jekyll theme for writers*. It's Jekyll's default and first theme.

You can visit the theme preview and its instructions [here](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/).

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/jekyll/minima.

## Development

To test your theme, run `script/server` (or `bundle exec jekyll serve`) and open your browser at http://localhost:4000. 
This starts a Jekyll server using your theme and the contents. As you make modifications, your site will regenerate and you 
should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
